        <Section title="Placing a bet">
          <p>
            Tap any odds to add a selection to your slip. Every leg multiplies together, so a longer
            ticket pays more but needs every leg to land.
          </p>
          <p>
            The price is re-read from the board when you submit, so a slip left open will never be
            struck at a stale price — if it moved, you are told rather than charged the old one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tap <strong>Book</strong> instead of Place bet to save the slip under a short code that
            anyone can load. Codes last 48 hours.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Deposits">
          <p>
            Deposit by mobile money. Your first confirmed deposit gets a one-time welcome bonus paid
            straight to your balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a payment completes while you are away from the app, opening your Account screen
            finds it and credits you. You never need to send a screenshot for an instant deposit.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Withdrawals">
          <p>
            Withdrawals unlock after <strong>three separate qualifying deposits</strong> — not one
            large one. Deposits are counted, not added up, so paying the whole amount at once
            unlocks nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Account screen shows exactly how many you have. Once unlocked, a withdrawal is
            reviewed and paid to your mobile money number.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="When bets settle" id="settlement">
          <p>
            Match result, goals, corners, handicaps and half-time markets settle automatically as
            soon as the match finishes — usually within about half a minute.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some outcomes cannot be decided automatically. A whole line that lands exactly (over 2
            goals in a 2-goal game) is a push, and a draw on a Draw No Bet is a void. Those are held
            for our team rather than guessed at, so nothing is ever settled against you by mistake.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Loyalty tiers" id="loyalty">
          <p>
            You earn one tier point for every unit you stake. Points come from turnover, not from
            deposits — funding an account you never play earns nothing.
