 * where the money goes is not decoration: a deposit lands in the player's own
 * betting wallet and is theirs to bet with, and a screen that asks for money
 * has to say what that money becomes.
 *
 * The arrow matters as much: without it the card is a wall, and a player who
 * opened the withdraw page to look around has no way back out.
